The Cat: [neutral] Ah! You're awake.
Alice: [grimace] ?
The Cat: Not very talkative, are we?
Alice: Where am I…?
The Cat: This, my skyfallen friend, is Wonderland.
Alice: [confused] Skyfallen?
The Cat: [smug] It's a compound word, my friend. Its meaning shouldn't be that difficult to par–
Alice: [annoyed] I know what it means.
The Cat: [laughing] Meow, aren't you fun at parties. 
Alice: Maybe you're just not half as funny as you think you are.
The Cat: [winking] In which case I'd still be funnier than you. 
The Cat: [neutral] Anyway, skyfallen means exactly what you think it means. You fell from the sky, and quite luckily, you fell in the River of Tears over there.

Alice: [neutral] The impact still should've killed me. Landing in water from a great height isn't any different from hitting concrete.
The Cat: Why not be grateful for your survival instead of questioning it too much? 
Alice: It just doesn't make sense.
The Cat: You'll find a lot of things don't make sense here. I'm talking to you right now, aren't I?
Alice: That's true.
The Cat: Now, what might your name be?
Alice: I'm called Alice.
The Cat: Well, Alice, you are a long way from home.

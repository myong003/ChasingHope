The Mouse: [relieved] I'm saved… I really thought I was a goner there. *Hack.* I don't think I'll get the taste of saltwater out of my mouth for a good month…
Alice: [surprise] You're… colorless.
The Cat: That's how things are here. It's what sets us apart from Kings.
Alice: [neutral] Oh… you are, too. I didn't notice earlier.
The Mouse: [shock] Eep! A cat! How terrible! If I had known, I'd have let the river take me instead!
The Cat: [smile] Well, that's rude. 
The Mouse: [frown] And a King…! Oh, what a combination…
The Cat: Speaking of which… this is the perfect opportunity to teach you what being a King really means here in Wonderland.
Alice: [frown] What does that mean?
The Mouse: [angry] No! Absolutely not, you–
The Cat: [smug] She saved you, didn't she? You owe her at least this much, don't you think?
The Mouse: The only Piece she has is you! 
The Cat: And when we win, she'll have two, and you'll be free of that King's influence.
The Mouse: Grr…
The Cat: You know I'm right.
Alice: [suspicious] I don't know what's going on, but I feel like I should have a say in this.
The Mouse: [annoyed] FINE! I'll go along with your plan, you stupid cat!
The Cat: [smile] Very good.
Alice: [confused] Huh?
The Mouse: Ready or not, here I come!
Alice: [shocked] HUH?

The Cat: [neutral] Ah! You're awake.
Alice: [grimace] ?
The Cat: Not very talkative, are we?
Alice: Where am I…?
The Cat: This, my skyfallen friend, is Wonderland.
Alice: [confused] Skyfallen?
The Cat: [smug] It's a compound word, my friend. Its meaning shouldn't be that difficult to par–
Alice: [annoyed] I know what it means.
The Cat: [laughing] Meow, aren't you fun at parties. 
Alice: Maybe you're just not half as funny as you think you are.
The Cat: [winking] In which case I'd still be funnier than you. 
The Cat: [neutral] Anyway, skyfallen means exactly what you think it means. You fell from the sky, and quite luckily, you fell in the River of Tears over there.
